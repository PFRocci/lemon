Quickstart
==========

This page gives an introduction in how to get started with LEMON,
showing the steps that would normally be necessary to reduce a data
set. In particular, this example assumes that we have a series of FITS
images from a transit of exoplanet `WASP-10b`_.

  Your **data is assumed to be calibrated**. Bias and dark
  subtraction, flat-fielding correction and any other necessary steps
  should have been performed before any data is fed to the pipeline.

Let's take a look at each of the steps of the data reduction.
